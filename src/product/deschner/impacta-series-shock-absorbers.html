                Meet the new Impacta® series hydraulic shock absorber from Deschner. We’ve engineered the Impacta series
                with the same legendary performance of our original Cushioneer® model shock absorber but in an
                affordable, self compensating unit. With the Impacta series, you can be assured of millions of cycles of
                maintenance free performance, at a price to fit your budget.

                Impacta industrial shock absorbers are the value choice to decelerate fast moving equipment without bang
                or bounce. They operate millions of cycles maintenance free and are leak resistant due to a unique
                sliding seal system. The Impacta series is an advance in shock absorber technology built to the same
                demanding quality and performance standards developed in over 50 years of manufacture of Cushioneer® and
                Kinechek® models.

                They use a stainless steel rod to provide long wear life and feature common threaded body sizes (M27,
                M25, M20, 14), making them interchangeable with a wide range of industrial shock absorbers.

                As with other Deschner models, the units are also equipped with a flexible rod wiper to prevent dirt,
                chips and moisture from entering the unit.

                Your machine application will run faster than ever before–with an easy to maintain unit. Impacta shock
                absorbers are small and streamlined, handy to mount in tight spots, yet powerful enough to solve most
                shock problems. Available in stroke lengths of 1/2″, 3/4″, & 1″ with capacities ranging from 250 up to
                900 in. lbs. See the Spec Sheets link on this page.

                Impactas are ideal for use on high speed machines such as reciprocating slides, flying die cut off
                machines, roll forming equipment, packaging machines, book binders–anywhere where fast moving equipment
                must be brought to a smooth stop.

                Because of its wide range of energy capacities, the Impacta is ideal for applications with fluctuating
                impact loads. The use of food grade oils in place of standard industrial hydraulic fluid allows Impactas
                to be used in medical and food processing applications.

                It provides a simple set up and trouble free operation in an economical unit. The unique “flow control”
                contained in the high-pressure cylinder of the self adjusting Impacta, is arranged so that the piston is
                increasingly restricted as the piston advances. This innovative flow control maintains a steady flow
                rate even under large changes in impact energy and the ensuing changes in fluid pressure. The result is
                a shock absorber that SELF COMPENSATES to a wide range of impact loads and provides a smooth stopping
                action for any load within its capacity. Once installed, the self adjusting Impacta works reliably — on
                its own — for millions of cycles. Improve your equipment performance, put the new Impacta self adjusting
                shock absorber to work for you.
