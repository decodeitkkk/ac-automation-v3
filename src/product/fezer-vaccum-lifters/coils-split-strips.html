                Whether in the automated process or in manual handling technology. For transporting and swiveling coils
                and slit strip rings, you can rely on the qualities of the VacuCoil device series.

                Whether for loading reel mandrels, separating cut slit strip rings or for automatic picking and storage
                - the "VacuCoils" impress with their robust design and intelligent safety concept. Loads of up to 10
                tons can be effortlessly transported or swivelled. FEZER relies on its proven safety features. Largely
                dimensioned vacuum accumulators and intelligent control and monitoring systems ensure absolutely safe
                handling of coils and slit strip rings.

                In addition, all manually controlled vacuum handling equipment features the unique main switch
                monitoring system. FEZER thus sets new standards for the safety of your employees

                FEZER also offers you special solutions for special handling tasks. For example, suction plates in "flattened design" can always pick up standing slit strips with different outer diameters centrically. With the "transparent suction plate", the operator always has a clear view and always hits the center. In addition, the coil lifters can also be equipped with centering mandrels or mechanical undergrippers if long transport distances have to be covered in large halls.
