                For the handling of dense or porous wooden elements, FEEZR offers you several device series with which these workpieces can be handled safely and reliably.

                With the VacuWood, planks, timbers and glue-laminated beams up to over 24 m in length can be handled. The vacuum is generated by dry-running vacuum pumps, which means that no oil residues can remain on the wood. This device series is particularly suitable for the safe restacking and commissioning of planks, timbers and glue-laminated beams.
                
                In addition, all manually controlled vacuum handling devices feature the unique "main switch monitoring". FEZER thus sets new standards for the safety of your employees.

                The VacuPoro series is suitable for transporting chipboard, MDF and OSB panels. Thanks to the powerful blower, these porous materials can be sucked up and transported absolutely safely. In addition, the unit series is also available with a swivel drive, which means that the panels can be picked up lying down and transferred to upright processing machines or vice versa.

                In addition, chipboard, MDF and OSB boards can also be handled with the VacuPowerlift tube lifter. The tube lifter is characterised above all by its fast working speed. Because it uses the vacuum not only for suction but also for lifting the panels, it does not need any additional lifting aids such as chain hoists or rope balancers.
