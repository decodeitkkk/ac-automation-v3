                FEZER offers you special suction pads for this purpose, which can also accommodate a range of diameters
                of different sizes. This saves you high set-up and adjustment costs. No matter whether you have to
                handle the tubes, rods and profiles manually or in automatic mode. In addition, FEZER offers you a wide
                range of options to adapt the tube and bar lifters to your personal production processes.

                This means that different suction circuits can be set up for variable pipe lengths, which switch
                themselves on or off automatically based on the existing lengths. This is done by means of built-in flow
                valves that automatically switch off the suction pads when they are not in use or by means of an
                intelligent system solution with vacuum monitoring and valve terminals.

                With hand-guided pipe and rod lifters, the required suction pads can be switched on and off manually. In
                addition, FEZER also offers you interchangeable designs if the diameter range becomes too large and can
                no longer be accommodated with one suction pad design.
