                Glass and window elements are absolutely vacuum-tight and therefore ideally suited for handling with vacuum technology.

                That is why FEZER offers you a wide range of application options for the automated and manual transport of these materials. Regardless of whether glass elements have to be transported horizontally, rotated or swivelled.

                FEZER offers you the ideal handling devices for glass elements with the VacuBoy, Mobilift and VacuPowerLift device series. These device series are so variably designed that they cover almost every requirement. Even for use on construction sites, FEZER offers you redundant device versions with dual-circuit vacuum systems in accordance with DIN EN 13155.
                
                In addition, all manually controlled vacuum handling devices have the unique "main switch monitoring". FEZER thus sets new standards for the safety of your employees.

Customised suction spiders are available for automated production processes, which can be flanged to robot systems and linear axes. Depending on the requirements, the suction spiders are designed with simple control via solenoid valves up to bus control via valve terminal technology.

Common to all handling tasks are FEZER's high safety requirements. Largely dimensioned vacuum reservoirs and intelligent monitoring of the vacuum circuits via electronic vacuum switches guarantee safe and rational transport with maximum operational safety.
